## Conclusions

The analysis shows that the Electronics category is the main driver of revenue, with laptops and headphones being the strongest-performing products. Cities like Toronto, Mexico City, and New York contribute a significant portion of total sales, suggesting strong market engagement in these regions.

Digital payment methods such as credit cards, debit cards, and PayPal are the most commonly used, which aligns with typical online purchasing behavior.

Monthly revenue reveals noticeable peaks, which could be linked to seasonal demand, promotional campaigns, or successful marketing periods.

These insights can help inform decisions related to inventory planning, marketing strategy, and customer engagement.
